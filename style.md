# 🎨 Style Guide

## S.1 Code Standards

All libhal code follows the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).
These are the authoritative baseline. Where libhal's style guide and the Core
Guidelines conflict, libhal's style guide takes precedence.

Code formatting is enforced by libhal's
[`.clang-format`](https://github.com/libhal/libhal/blob/main/.clang-format)
file, which uses the Mozilla C++ style as a base with adjustments. Do not
manually reformat code, run `pre-commit run -a` and let it handle this.

Static analysis is enforced by libhal's
[`.clang-tidy`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libhal/libhal/refs/heads/main/.clang-tidy)
file. CI will reject code that introduces new clang-tidy violations. Address
violations directly rather than suppressing them with `// NOLINT` unless a
genuine false positive is documented inline with the following format:

```C++
// NOLINT(<violation-check-name>): <reason>
```

Here is an example:

```C++
// NOLINT(readability-identifier-naming): name of a 3rd party symbol we must define for the application to work properly.
```

## S.2 Naming Conventions

Naming follows the standard library convention. Naming rules are enforced by
`.clang-tidy` and spelling is enforced by `cspell` via `pre-commit run -a`.

### S.2.1 General rules

| Construct                 | Convention                 | Example                            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Namespaces                | `snake_case`               | `hal::msp0`                        |
| Types and classes         | `snake_case`               | `output_pin`, `i2c_bus`            |
| Template parameters       | `CamelCase`                | `Container`, `WordType`            |
| Functions and methods     | `snake_case`               | `driver_read()`, `set_level()`     |
| Variables                 | `snake_case`               | `baud_rate`, `timeout`             |
| Constants and `constexpr` | `snake_case`               | `max_frequency`, `default_timeout` |
| Macros                    | `CAP_CASE`                 | `HAL_CHECK`                        |
| Function parameters       | `p_` prefix + `snake_case` | `p_timeout`, `p_address`           |
| Private/protected members | `m_` prefix + `snake_case` | `m_baud_rate`, `m_i2c`             |

Avoid macros entirely where possible. See S.7.

### S.2.2 Abbreviations

Prefer full words over abbreviations. A reader should not need domain knowledge
to understand a variable name.

```cpp
// ❌ Unclear abbreviations
u32 cnt = 0;
u32 cdl = freq / 2;
u32 cdh = freq - cdl;

// ✅ Full words
u32 count = 0;
u32 clock_divider_low = frequency / 2;
u32 clock_divider_high = frequency - clock_divider_low;
```

**Allowed abbreviations** are those whose abbreviated form is more universally
understood than the expanded form:

- Hardware protocol names: `i2c`, `spi`, `uart`, `can`, `usb`, `dma`
- Signal and peripheral names: `adc`, `dac`, `pwm`, `gpio`
- Common units and types: `irq`, `isr`, `mcu`
**Register names** are exempt from this rule. If a register is named `CR1` or
`PCLKDIV` in the datasheet, use that name directly. This makes it easier to
cross-reference code against the reference manual.

```cpp
// ✅ Matches the datasheet - acceptable
reg->CR1 |= enable_bit;
reg->PCLKDIV = divider;
```

If `cspell` flags an identifier that is a legitimate technical abbreviation or
a datasheet-derived name, add it to the project's `cspell.json` dictionary
rather than suppressing the check.

## S.3 Formatting

Most formatting is enforced automatically by `clang-format` and `pre-commit`.
The rules below either require developer judgment or explain the rationale
behind what the tools enforce.

### S.3.1 Line length

Keep lines within **80 characters**. `clang-format` handles this automatically.
For the rare case where wrapping would hurt readability more than the long line,
suppress with `clang-format off/on` and a comment explaining why:

```cpp
// clang-format off
// URL must remain intact for reference manual cross-linking
// https://some-very-long-datasheet-url.com/reference/register-map/section-12
// clang-format on
```

### S.3.2 File endings

All files must end with a newline character and use LF line endings. Trailing
whitespace is not permitted. These are enforced automatically by pre-commit and
do not require manual attention.

### S.3.3 Number radix for bit manipulation

When working with register values or bit masks, use only **binary** or **hex**.
Never use decimal or octal. They obscure the bit-level structure that matters
when reading hardware code.

```cpp
// ❌ Decimal and octal hide the bit pattern
u32 mask = 15;
u32 flags = 0377;

// ✅ Binary shows the bit pattern directly
constexpr auto mask = hal::bit_mask::from(0, 3);

// ✅ Hex is acceptable when the value comes from a datasheet
constexpr u32 pll_config = 0x0040'001F;
```

Use digit separators (`'`) to group bits into readable chunks for long binary
or hex literals:

```cpp
constexpr u32 config = 0b1000'0011'0000'0000;
constexpr u32 base_address = 0x4000'0000;
```

### S.3.4 Documentation

Every public API must be documented with Doxygen-style comments. This is
enforced by the `doxygen-check` pre-commit hook, undocumented public APIs
will fail CI.

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Set the output voltage level of the pin.
 *
 * @param p_high If true, drives the pin to the logic high voltage.
 *               If false, drives the pin to the logic low voltage.
 */
void level(bool p_high);
```

Document the *why* and *what*, not the *how*. Avoid restating the function
signature in prose. If a parameter has constraints or units, state them
explicitly.

Internal implementation details and private members do not require Doxygen
comments, but non-obvious logic should have inline `//` comments explaining
intent.

## S.5 Bit Manipulation

Manual bit manipulation is error prone and hard to review. libhal provides
`hal::bit_modify`, `hal::bit_value`, and `hal::bit_extract` from `libhal-util`
to handle bit operations in a readable and verifiable way.

### S.5.1 Named compile-time bit masks

Always give bit masks names. Anonymous magic numbers in bit operations are
difficult to cross-reference against a datasheet and easy to get wrong.

Always prefer the template form of bit mask APIs over the runtime form. A
`constexpr` bit mask passed as a template argument gives the compiler full
knowledge of the operation at compile time, enabling significantly better
code generation.

```cpp
// ✅ Named, constexpr, template form
constexpr auto state   = hal::bit_mask::from(4, 5);
constexpr auto enable  = hal::bit_mask::from(3);
constexpr auto prescale = hal::bit_mask::from(6, 13);

hal::bit_modify(reg->control)
  .insert<prescale>(divider)
  .clear<lower_power_mode>()
  .set<enable>();

// ❌ Anonymous and runtime - no compiler optimization, no readability
reg->control = (reg->control & ~0x3F40) | ((divider << 6) & 0x3F40);
```

### S.5.2 `hal::bit_modify`

Use `hal::bit_modify` to read-modify-write a volatile hardware register.
It copies the register value to a temporary, applies all operations to the
temporary, then writes it back on destruction. This avoids multiple volatile
reads and writes.

```cpp
reg_t* reg = get_peripheral_register();

hal::bit_modify(reg->control)
  .insert<pre_scalar>(freq() / desired_frequency)
  .clear<lower_power_mode>()
  .set<enable>();
```

Chain all operations on the same register in a single `bit_modify` call.
This keeps the read-modify-write atomic with respect to the surrounding code
and produces tighter assembly.

### S.5.3 `hal::bit_value`

Use `hal::bit_value` to construct a register value entirely at compile time.
This is useful for default configurations and constants that are known before
runtime.

```cpp
constexpr auto default_pin_config = hal::bit_value(0U)
  .insert<mode>(0x04)
  .clear<high_slew_rate>()
  .set<high_speed_mode>()
  .to<std::uint32_t>();
```

**Tail chaining** - calling the next method directly on the return value of the
previous keeps the entire lifetime of the object visible to the compiler.
This allows GCC and Clang to collapse the chain into a single constant,
producing optimal code with no runtime cost.

### S.5.4 `hal::bit_extract`

Use `hal::bit_extract` to read a field out of a register value.

```cpp
// Polling on a status bit
while (hal::bit_extract<state>(reg->status) == states::busy) {
  continue;
}

// Extracting a multi-bit ADC result
float my_adc::driver_read() {
  constexpr auto capture_value = hal::bit_mask::from(4, 11);
  return hal::bit_extract<capture_value>(reg->status);
}
```

### S.5.5 Exception: native shift and OR for concatenation

When assembling a value from multiple bytes rather than operating on a single
register field, native shift and OR can be clearer than `bit_value`. This
commonly arises when combining bytes read from a sensor over I2C or SPI.

```cpp
// ✅ Readable concatenation with native syntax
auto data = hal::write_then_read<2>(m_i2c, 0x11, addr, timeout);
std::uint32_t val = data[0] << 4 | data[1] >> 4;
```

Choose whichever form is clearer for the specific operation. The goal is
reviewability, not mechanical rule-following.

## S.6 Classes & Types

### S.6.1 Declaration order

Class sections must appear in this order: public, then protected, then private.
Omit any section that would be empty.

Within each section, follow this order:

1. Types and type aliases (`using`, `enum class`, nested structs and classes)
2. Static constants
3. Factory functions
4. Constructors and assignment operators
5. Destructor
6. All other member functions
7. All other data members

```cpp
// Example library
class my_driver {
public:
  // 1. Types
  struct settings {
    hal::hertz frequency = 100'000 * si::hertz;
  };

  // 3. Factory
  static hal::deferred_ptr<my_driver> create(async::context& p_context,
                                              settings const& p_settings
                                              /* arguments */);
  // 4. Constructors
  my_driver(/* arguments */);

  // 5. Destructor
  ~my_driver() override = default;

  // 6. Member functions
  hal::celsius read_temperature();

private:
  // 7. Data members
};
```

Do not define large method bodies inline within the class definition. Only
trivial or performance-critical methods that are very short may be defined
inline. Template classes are an exception as they must be defined within a
module interface file.

### S.6.2 Avoid `bool` as a member

`bool` has poor information density as it occupies a full byte per entry. A
single `bool` member is acceptable. When multiple boolean flags are needed,
use `std::bitset` with named `constexpr` index positions to pack them into
the minimum footprint.

```cpp
// ❌ Three separate bytes for three flags
bool m_enabled;
bool m_inverted;
bool m_open_drain;

// ✅ Three bits packed into one word
static constexpr std::size_t enabled_bit    = 0;
static constexpr std::size_t inverted_bit   = 1;
static constexpr std::size_t open_drain_bit = 2;
std::bitset<3> m_flags;
```

!!! note
    `std::bitset` uses a backing block of `unsigned long` internally. On
    32-bit architectures this means a `bitset` of any size from 1 to 32 bits
    still occupies 4 bytes. Pack enough flags together to make that footprint
    worthwhile.

### S.6.3 Avoid `bool` as a parameter

Boolean parameters at a call site are unreadable without looking up the
function signature. See
["Clean code: The curse of a boolean parameter"](https://medium.com/@amlcurran/clean-code-the-curse-of-a-boolean-parameter-c237a830b7a3)
for a detailed treatment.

```cpp
// ❌ What does 'false' mean here?
pin.configure(true, false, false);

// ✅ Each state is self-describing at the call site
pin.configure(pin_direction::output,
              pin_drive::push_pull,
              pin_resistor::none);
```

A `bool` parameter is acceptable when it is the only parameter and reads
naturally as a logical switch at the call site.

```cpp
// ✅ Reads clearly without context
led.level(true);
led.level(false);
```

!!! note
    A `hal::bool` type is planned for a future release. It will provide a
    type-safe named boolean that is self-documenting at call sites without
    requiring a full enum. This section will be updated when it lands.

### S.6.5 `[[nodiscard]]`

Apply `[[nodiscard]]` to any function whose return value being discarded is
almost certainly a bug. The primary case is factory functions: discarding the
return value of `create()` constructs and immediately destroys the driver
without it ever being used.

```cpp
// ✅ Compiler error if the caller drops the return value
[[nodiscard]] static hal::deferred_ptr<my_driver> create(
  async::context& p_context,
  hal::ptr<hal::i2c> p_i2c,
  settings const& p_settings);
```

When the reason a discard is wrong is not obvious from the function name alone,
add a string message to `[[nodiscard]]` so the compiler diagnostic is
self-explanatory.

```cpp
[[nodiscard("Discarding the handle releases the lock immediately.")]]
lock_guard acquire_lock();
```

Do not apply `[[nodiscard]]` to functions that are called primarily for their
side effects or where ignoring the return value is a legitimate pattern.

```cpp
// ❌ Doesn't make sense - called for its side effect
[[nodiscard]] void reset();
```

## S.7 Restrictions

### S.7.1 Avoid macros

Only use macros when something cannot be expressed any other way. In practice
this is extremely rare. Nearly every macro can be replaced with `constexpr`
variables, `constexpr` functions, or templates.

```cpp
// ❌ Macro with no justification
#define MAX_CHANNELS 8
#define CLAMP(x, lo, hi) ((x) < (lo) ? (lo) : (x) > (hi) ? (hi) : (x))

// ✅ constexpr equivalents
constexpr std::size_t max_channels = 8;

template<typename T>
constexpr T clamp(T x, T lo, T hi) {
  return std::clamp(x, lo, hi);
}
```

Only use preprocessor `#if` when `if constexpr` cannot achieve the same result.

### S.7.2 Never include `<iostream>`

Including any `<iostream>` header incurs an automatic 150 kB binary size
penalty. This happens even if the code never calls `std::cout` or any related
function, as the global stream objects are constructed unconditionally at
startup.

```cpp
// ❌ Never in library or driver code
#include <iostream>
#include <ostream>
#include <sstream>
```

`<iostream>` may be used in libraries that exclusively target host-side unit
testing and are never compiled for embedded targets.

### S.7.3 Use PMR for allocation

Raw heap allocation via `new`, `delete`, `malloc`, or `free` is generally forbidden in embedded systems. These bypass the caller's memory strategy, are
incompatible with systems that have no heap, and make it impossible to use
custom allocators for specific memory regions such as DMA-capable RAM.

All allocation must go through `std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<>`. The caller
provides the allocator, giving application developers full control over where memory comes from.

```cpp
#include <memory_resource> // contains the PMR definitions

// ❌ Raw heap allocation - bypasses caller's memory strategy
class my_driver {
  my_driver() {
    m_buffer = new std::byte[256];
  }
  std::byte* m_buffer;
};

// ✅ PMR allocation - caller controls where memory comes from
class my_driver {
  my_driver(std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<> p_resource, std::size_t p_size)
    : m_buffer(p_resource, p_size)
  {}
  std::pmr::vector<std::byte> m_buffer;
};
```

Allocation should happen at object construction time, not during normal
operation. A driver that allocates during a read or write call is
incompatible with real-time systems and deterministic memory budgets.

### S.7.5 Avoid `<thread>`

Embedded toolchains do not provide `<thread>`. Including it will fail to
compile when cross-compiling for any baremetal target. Use the async context
model for concurrency instead.

```cpp
// ❌ Will not compile on baremetal targets
#include <thread>
std::thread worker([]{ ... });

// ✅ Use async context for concurrent work
async::future<void> worker(async::context& p_context) {
  co_await do_work(p_context);
}
```

!!! note
    libhal does plan to provide `<thread>`-compatible implementations for
    application developers building on top of libhal. These implementations
    are intended for end users and their applications. They must not be used
    within libhal libraries themselves.

### S.7.6 No logging from drivers

Drivers must not write to stdout or stderr. This means no calls to:

- `std::printf` / `std::fprintf`
- `std::puts` / `std::fputs`
- `std::print` / `std::println` (C++26)

The role of logging belongs to the application, not its drivers. A driver that
logs on every read or write is as surprising as a file I/O library that spams
the console on every operation.

```cpp
// ❌ Driver owns no logging responsibility
celsius read_temperature() {
  auto raw = read_raw(p_ctx);
  std::printf("raw=%d\n", raw);  // don't do this
  return to_celsius(raw);
}

// ✅ Return the value and let the application decide what to do with it
celsius read_temperature() {
  auto raw = read_raw(p_ctx);
  return to_celsius(raw);
}
```

!!! note
    S.7.2 already prohibits `<iostream>` for binary size reasons. This rule
    covers the remaining C-style output functions that do not carry the same
    penalty but still violate driver responsibility boundaries.

### S.7.7 No halting or termination

Drivers must not stop execution. The following are forbidden in driver code:

- `std::abort()`
- `std::exit()` and `std::quick_exit()`
- `std::terminate()` (exception if something goes so wrong the system must be
  taken down)
- Infinite loops that never yield control

An application must always retain the ability to decide what happens when
something goes wrong. Drivers surface errors through exceptions and return
control to the caller. The application then decides whether to retry, log, shut
down, or recover.

```cpp
// ❌ Driver takes control away from the application
if (!initialized) {
  std::abort();
}

// ❌ Spin loop with no exit - hangs the system permanently
while (true) { continue; }

// ✅ Throw and let the application handle it
if (!initialized) {
  throw not_initialized{};
}
```

### S.7.8 Avoid `noexcept`

Do not annotate functions with `noexcept`. Since C++17, `noexcept` is part of
a function's type. Removing it in a later version is a breaking ABI change.
libhal keeps the option open for which APIs throw as the library evolves.
Committing to `noexcept` prematurely closes that door.

```cpp
// ❌ ABI commitment - cannot be un-noexcept without breaking callers
[[nodiscard]] std::uint16_t read_sample() noexcept;

// ✅ No annotation - unannotated functions are implicitly potentially-throwing
[[nodiscard]] std::uint16_t read_sample();
```

## S.8 Namespace Hygiene

### S.8.1 Stay within a designated namespace

All libhal code must live within the `hal` namespace or a library-specific
namespace. Never place symbols in the global namespace or in `std`.

```cpp
// ❌ Global namespace pollution
class output_pin { ... };
void configure_pin(output_pin& p_pin);

// ✅ Scoped to the library namespace
namespace hal::lpc40 {
  class output_pin { ... };
  void configure_pin(output_pin& p_pin);
}
```

Headers included via the global module fragment may introduce global
namespace symbols. Do not re-expose them and do not rely on their names
being available outside the translation unit that includes them.

---

## S.9 Headers (Legacy / Compatibility)

libhal v5 uses C++20 modules as the primary compilation model. All new library
code must be written as module files. Headers exist only for:

- wrapping third-party C APIs for use in the global module fragment (see
  [S.4.4](style.md#s44-global-module-fragment))
- compatibility builds targeting toolchains without module support

Do not create new `.hpp` headers for library code. When working in a
compatibility context, follow the rules below.

### S.9.1 Self-contained and extension

Every header must compile correctly on its own without relying on symbols
provided by a prior include in whatever translation unit includes it.

Use `.hpp` for C++ headers and `.h` for C headers.

### S.9.2 Include guards

Use `#pragma once`. Do not use `#ifndef` guards.

```cpp
// ❌ Verbose and collision-prone
#ifndef HAL_GPIO_HPP_
#define HAL_GPIO_HPP_
// ...
#endif  // HAL_GPIO_HPP_

// ✅ Simple and sufficient
#pragma once
```

### S.9.3 Include what you use

Include a header for every symbol used directly. Do not rely on transitive
includes. A symbol appearing because another header pulls it in is not part of
that header's API contract and may disappear at any time.

```cpp
// ❌ Assumes <cstdint> arrives transitively
#pragma once
void set_baud(std::uint32_t p_rate);

// ✅ Declares its own dependency
#pragma once
#include <cstdint>
void set_baud(std::uint32_t p_rate);
```

Also remember to remove unused headers.

### S.9.4 Include order

Group includes in the order below, separated by blank lines. Within each group,
`clang-format` sorts alphabetically, do not do it manually.

1. C standard library headers, using `<>` (`<cstdint>`, `<cstring>`)
2. C third-party headers, using `<>` (`<minimp3.h>`)
3. C++ standard library headers, using `<>` (`<array>`, `<span>`)
4. C++ third-party and libhal ecosystem headers, using `<>` (`<libhal-util/serial.hpp>`)
5. Local project headers, using `""` (`"resource_list.hpp"`)

```cpp
#pragma once

// 1. C standard library
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>

// 2. C third-party
#include <minimp3.h>

// 3. C++ standard library
#include <array>
#include <span>

// 4. C++ third-party / libhal ecosystem
#include <libhal-util/serial.hpp>
#include <libhal-util/steady_clock.hpp>

// 5. Local project
#include "resource_list.hpp"
```

!!! note
    In test files, `boost.ut` must always be the last include. It overloads
    `operator<<` for `ostream` and must see prior type declarations to generate
    correct output for test failures.

## S.10 Memory-Mapped I/O

Peripheral registers on microcontrollers are accessed by reading and writing
to fixed physical addresses. This section covers how to declare, address, and
access those registers correctly and safely.

### S.10.1 Declare register maps as `volatile` structs

Model a peripheral's register block as a plain struct where every hardware
register is a `volatile` unsigned integer member. The struct must be
standard-layout so that `sizeof` and `offsetof` are reliable.

```cpp
struct register_map {
  volatile std::uint32_t control;    // offset 0x00
  volatile std::uint32_t status;     // offset 0x04
  volatile std::uint32_t data;       // offset 0x08
  std::uint32_t          reserved0;  // offset 0x0C - unused, not volatile
  volatile std::uint32_t baud_rate;  // offset 0x10
};
```

Every readable or writable hardware register must be `volatile`. Reserved or
unused registers that are never accessed do not need to be `volatile`, but
must still be present to maintain correct offsets.

Use `std::uint32_t`, `std::uint16_t`, or `std::uint8_t` to match the register
width specified in the datasheet. Never use `int` or `unsigned int` directly
as their width is implementation-defined.

### S.10.2 Why `volatile` is mandatory

Without `volatile`, the compiler may cache a register's value in a CPU register
and skip subsequent reads, or eliminate writes it considers redundant. Hardware
registers change independently of the CPU, via peripherals, DMA engines, or
interrupts, so every access must reach the hardware.

```cpp
// ❌ Without volatile, the compiler may hoist the read out of the loop
struct register_map {
  std::uint32_t status;   // missing volatile
};

// The compiler sees no writes to status and may transform this into:
//   if (reg->status & ready_bit) { while(true) {} }
while (!(reg->status & ready_bit)) {}

// ✅ volatile forces every iteration to re-read from the hardware address
struct register_map {
  volatile std::uint32_t status;
};
```

### S.10.3 Obtain the register pointer via `reinterpret_cast`

Declare the peripheral base address as a `constexpr std::uintptr_t` and cast
it to a pointer once. Store and pass the typed pointer, never the raw integer.

```cpp
// ✅ Address constant is named and traced to the datasheet
constexpr std::uintptr_t uart0_base = 0x4000'C000;

register_map* reg = reinterpret_cast<register_map*>(uart0_base);

hal::bit_modify(reg->control).set<enable>();
```

```cpp
// ❌ Casting at every use site - type is implicit, address is not named
*reinterpret_cast<std::uint32_t*>(0x4000'C004) |= 0x1;
```

`reinterpret_cast` is the only sanctioned cast for this operation. Do not use
C-style casts.

### S.10.4 Scope register maps to the translation unit

Register map structs and their associated bit mask definitions belong in an
anonymous namespace inside the module implementation `.cpp` file. Anonymous
namespace linkage makes them invisible outside the translation unit, so no
naming ceremony is required. Use plain descriptive names.

```cpp
// In gpio.cpp (module implementation - not visible to consumers)
module hal:gpio;

namespace {

struct register_map {
  volatile std::uint32_t direction;
  volatile std::uint32_t mask;
  volatile std::uint32_t pin;
  volatile std::uint32_t set;
  volatile std::uint32_t clear;
};

struct direction_register {
  static constexpr auto output = hal::bit_mask::from(0);
};

} // namespace
